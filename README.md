# Ball_Sorting_Machine
## Team Members: Ayesha Khatun, Jing Yang Kuo, Sushil Jagmohan, Yousouf Amologbe

Our Team worked on the 'Ball Sorting Machine Project' as a part of the MAE (Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering) Lab - I course.  As a team lead, I have organized team meetings, created different project plans, actively encouraged the team members to work on the design for better perfromance as well as dedicated myself in the design revision process. The overall experience ganined from this Mechanical Team project, gave me invaluable insights on basic mechanical system designing phases and engineering team management process.
