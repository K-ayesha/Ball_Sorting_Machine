Our Team worked on the 'Ball Sorting Machine Project' as a part of the MAE (Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering) Lab - I course.  As a team leads, I have organized team meetings, created different project plans, actively encouraged the team members to work on the design for better performance as well as dedicated myself in the design revision process. The overall experience gained from this Mechanical Team project gave me invaluable insights into basic mechanical system designing phases and engineering team management process.

#### Abstract
This project was aimed at designing an automated system using the fundamental theories and techniques we learned in this course. This system used an Arduino to evenly distribute 30 steel balls into three bins mounted on a ball screw. Our design involved several design components such as a color sensor, an Arduino, breadboard, and a servo motor. In general, our system partially completes the goal that is required but has some inconsistencies in certain areas.

#### Introduction
Three different materials and ball specifications are introduced. The birch, steel, and acetal resin need to be deposited into 3 separate bins. Steel and birch have the same diameter of ⅜”. The acetal resin ball is slightly smaller at 5/16”. 10 balls of each type are placed into the funnel randomly, which then directly attaches to the sorting machine to be deposited in particular compartments of collecting bin. Our goal is to design and build a system with a budget of 75$ and to sort the balls in a timely manner with precision.

Our first design began with the use of a TCS34725 color sensor which then was replaced using TCS3200 for better performance. Also, other significant change decisions had been made throughout time like time interval for each operation, restricting light passing during sensor operation, structural changes, etc. 

There were many setbacks that our project had to deal with such as lack of sufficient time, proper equipment, and an unreliable light-sensitive sensor. The only major change throughout the development was the use of a different sensor. The system is still viable but requires major tweaks to the electrical side which can result in a complete change to the design to help the sensor read the balls more consistently and efficiently. Overall our system completes the goal that is required but lacks fault detection on the electrical side of the project.
